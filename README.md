# FIFA-Player-Analysis-and-Classification
This Jupyter notebook contains an in-depth analysis of FIFA player data, focusing on central defenders (CB). The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning techniques. 
Key features of this project:
    Data loading and initial exploration using pandas
    Player classification based on overall scores
    Random Forest Classifier to identify important features for central defenders
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification to categorize players as 'World Class', 'Good', or 'Mediocre'
    Optimization of KNN model parameters for best performance
    The project demonstrates skills in data manipulation, feature engineering, and the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to solve a real-world sports analytics problem."
